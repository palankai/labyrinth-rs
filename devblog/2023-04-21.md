I'm working towards better controlling the character and enabling it on mobile.

## Event-based control

Instead of relying on keyboard events,
I send an event when the user presses relevant keys.

```rust
pub struct MoveRequested {
    pub direction: Vec3,
}
```

The main advantage of using an event like this is that I can send this event
from a UI component designed to control the game.

## Mobile play

I changed the play button to check if I can click it on mobile.
I can. The plan is to have control buttons on the bottom of the screen.
Pushing those buttons, I can send the same `MoveRequested` events.
