I'm working towards to be able to better control the character and play the game on mobile.

## Event based control

Instead of relying on keyboard events,
I decided to send an event when the user presses relevant keys.

```rust
pub struct MoveRequested {
    pub direction: Vec3,
}
```

The main advantage using an event like this, that I can send this event
from a UI component, designed to control the game.
