## Little improvements

- I've added the debug inspector
- Changed the optimisation level (as recommended)

## Nicer movement

It is close to how I imagine the main character moving.
I've implemented intermittent movement. It is almost continuous when you keep pressing
the arrow key.

```rust
if movement_timer.just_finished() {
    move_player(
        &mut player_transform,
        &mut camera_transform,
        final_target_position,
    );
    commands.entity(entity).remove::<MovingPlayer>();
} else {
    let position = starging_position + step * movement_timer.percent() * 0.85;
    move_player(&mut player_transform, &mut camera_transform, position);
}
```

The `0.85` gives a little jumping, intermittent feel for it.

The "only" thing is left to implement animation between tiles.
But the game is good enough to add more game elements and make the game gamier.
