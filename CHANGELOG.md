# Changelog

## 2023-04-18

- Collision checker is way better (turns out I don't need to rewrite it, just use it right)

## 2023-04-17

- Build it for WASM
- Implement simple collider

### WASM
Yay, it's exciting. *It was just too simple ;)*

### Collider and keyboard movements
Still not great but better.
I probably need to write a better collider which can tell the list of sides colliding.
I want to be able to slide next to a wall even if I pressing against the wall.

## 2023-04-16 - Initial version

- Basic labyrinth generation
- Simple movement

The movement isn't great, but works.
I use the .just_released() method so the sprite isn't moving too fast.
